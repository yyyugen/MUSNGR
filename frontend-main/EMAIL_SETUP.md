# Email Notification Setup for Musngr

This document explains how to set up email notifications for video upload completion.

## Features Implemented

✅ **Email Notifications**: Automatic email sent when video upload completes  
✅ **Beautiful Email Templates**: HTML email with video link and details  
✅ **In-App Success Modal**: Rich modal with video link, sharing options, and copy functionality  
✅ **User Preferences**: Users can enable/disable email notifications in settings  
✅ **Fallback Handling**: Email failures don't break the upload process  

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Resend API Key

1. Go to [Resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the API key

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Update your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Email Notifications
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 3. Domain Setup (For Production)

For production use, you'll need to:

1. **Verify your domain** in Resend dashboard
2. **Update the "from" address** in `src/lib/email.ts`:
   ```typescript
   from: 'Musngr <notifications@yourdomain.com>',
   ```

### 4. Test the Setup

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Sign in with Google
3. Upload a video with audio and image files
4. Check that:
   - ✅ Success modal appears with video link
   - ✅ Email is sent (check console logs)
   - ✅ Video link works correctly

## How It Works

### Email Flow

1. **User uploads video** → Dashboard triggers video creation
2. **Video uploads to YouTube** → API route receives success response
3. **Check user preferences** → Only send email if user has enabled notifications
4. **Send email notification** → Resend API sends beautiful HTML email
5. **Show success modal** → In-app modal with sharing options

### User Preferences

Users can control email notifications in **Settings > Notifications**:

- ✅ **Video Upload Completion** (enabled by default)
- ⚙️ Other notification types (for future features)

Preferences are stored in localStorage and checked before sending emails.

- 🎵 **Branded design** with Musngr logo
- ✅ **Success confirmation** with checkmark
- 🎬 **Direct video link** button
- 📋 **Video details** (title, ID, upload date)

```

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending

1. **Check API key**: Ensure `RESEND_API_KEY` is set correctly
2. **Check console logs**: Look for error messages in server logs
3. **Verify domain**: For production, ensure domain is verified in Resend
4. **Check user preferences**: User might have disabled email notifications

### Modal Not Showing

1. **Check state management**: Ensure `showSuccessModal` state is being set
2. **Check video data**: Ensure `uploadedVideoData` contains required fields
3. **Check imports**: Ensure `VideoSuccessModal` is imported correctly

### Preferences Not Saving

1. **Check localStorage**: Ensure browser supports localStorage
2. **Check console**: Look for localStorage errors
3. **Clear storage**: Try clearing localStorage and testing again

## Development Notes

- Email sending is **non-blocking** - upload success isn't dependent on email success
- Preferences are **client-side only** - consider server-side storage for production
- Email templates are **inline CSS** for maximum email client compatibility
- **Fallback text version** is included for accessibility

## Future Enhancements

- 📊 **Email analytics** tracking
- 🎨 **Custom email templates** per user
- 📱 **Push notifications** for mobile
- 🔄 **Retry mechanism** for failed emails
- 💾 **Server-side preference storage**
